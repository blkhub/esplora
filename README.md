## Building

### Requirements

Esplora needs the following :  
- lib Cairo2 dev
- lib jpeg dev
- lib pango1.0 dev
- lib gif dev
- Compilations tools, with g++

On a Debian/Ubuntu system :
```apt-get install libcairo2-dev libjpeg-dev libpango1.0-dev libgif-dev build-essential g++```

To build the static assets directory for production deployment, set config options (see below)
and run `$ npm run dist`. The files will be created under `dist/`.

Because Esplora is a single-page app, the HTTP server needs to be configured to serve the `index.html` file in reply to missing pages.
See [`contrib/nginx.conf.in`](contrib/nginx.conf.in) for example nginx configuration (TL;DR: `try_files $uri /index.html`).

## Pre-rendering server (noscript)

To start a pre-rendering server that generates static HTML replies suitable for noscript users, run:

```bash
# (clone, cd, "npm install" and configure as above)

$ export STATIC_ROOT=http://localhost:5000/ # for loading CSS, images and fonts
$ npm run prerender-server
```

The server will be available at http://localhost:5001/

## Configuration options

All options are optional.

### GUI options

as environment variables :

- `NODE_ENV` - set to `production` to enable js minification, or to `development` to disable (defaults to `production`)
- `BASE_HREF` - base href for user interface (defaults to `/`, change if not served from the root directory)
- `STATIC_ROOT` - root for static assets (defaults to `BASE_HREF`, change to load static assets from a different server)
- `API_URL` - URL for HTTP REST API (defaults to `/api`, change if the API is available elsewhere)
- `CANONICAL_URL` - absolute base url for user interface (optional, only required for opensearch and canonical link tags)
- `NATIVE_ASSET_LABEL` - the name of the network native asset (defaults to `BTC`)
- `SITE_TITLE` - website title for `<title>` (defaults to `Block Explorer`)
- `SITE_DESC` - meta description (defaults to `Esplora Block Explorer`)
- `HOME_TITLE` - text for homepage title (defaults to `SITE_TITLE`)
- `SITE_FOOTER` - text for page footer (defaults to `Powered by esplora`)
- `HEAD_HTML` - custom html to inject at the end of `<head>`
- `FOOT_HTML` - custom html to inject at the end of `<body>`
- `CUSTOM_ASSETS` - space separated list of static assets to add to the build
- `CUSTOM_CSS` - space separated list of css files to append into `style.css`
- `NOSCRIPT_REDIR` - redirect noscript users to `{request_path}?nojs` (should be captured server-side and redirected to the prerender server, also see `PRERENDER_URL` in dev server options)

Menu configuration (useful for inter-linking multiple instances on different networks):

- `MENU_ITEMS` - json map of menu items, where the key is the label and the value is the url
- `MENU_ACTIVE` - the active menu item identified by its label

### Pre-rendering server options

All GUI options, plus:

- `PORT` - port to bind pre-rendering server (defaults to `5001`)

## Running

In the esplora directory :

```
npm install
npm run dist
```

Don\'t do that as the root user, it may not work.
